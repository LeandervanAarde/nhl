<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project
<!-- header image of project -->
![image1][image1]

### Project Description

Welcome to CHEL! CHEL is a web based application that tracks the statistics of NHL players and Teams. On this application users are 
able to view the top Teams in the league, a range of player statistics being compared and teams being compared. You are also able to track the performance of these players over the course of their careers in categories. Live scores are updated daily to give users the latest scores on the most exciting games from the past 24 hours. 

### Built With
* Css
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Chartsjs](https://www.chartjs.org/)
* [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
* [model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/)

### Get up to date statistics of NHL players!

Through the use of the NHL-API we were able to get the most relevant and up-to-date data of the NHL!

![image3][image3]
### Compare players through chartsjs! 

The implementation of chartjs allows users to compare data of player and teams in order to get a visual idea of where players stand in the NHL

![image4][image4]
### Up to date scores
See the latest and most up to date scores of 2 recent games

### Compare Teams
Compare teams in NHL to see how they match up.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. <br>
In this project I had started the conceptual process through identifying the correct API, once I had identified the API that I could use and extract a sufficient amount of data from, I had gone on to find inspiration from other web applications/ websites. This would entail looking at how other websites approached data visualisation and finding an overall design and colour scheme.
<br> 
Throughout the concept ideation I would also be learning more about react and the implementation of react so that I could identify what I could use and what not. 

### Ideation

### Wireframes
 In order to get the best result and most user-centered design that I could produce, I had to create wireframes. Giving me the opportunity to identify any problems with the design earlier on and thus saving time during the development process.

### Custom UI
  In order to make a users experience more pleasureable, I have added a 3D model of a puck through the implementation of the model-viewer cdn. This makes a users experience more pleasureable considering that it's something interesting that's not generally seen withina web application.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized React `Charts.JS` dependency for Data visualization
* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* API End Point: <a href="https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md#team-stats">NHL API</a>
* `Plugin` for <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/">Model viewer</a>
* Implemented Responsiveness with `React-Bootstrap`.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Over the course of this project I have learned about the implementation of React and some of the basic capabilities. I have a better understanding of why the framework is so popular. I have a grown with a basic knowledge in components, axios calls, useStates, UseRef's and useEffects. 
* I have learned about the implementation of React chartsjs and how to use props to implement Chartsjs
* I enjoyed the challenges that this API brought me and solving issues in a different way. I definetly enjoyed the progression of this project and the final outcome that it has presented. Furthermoer, I enjoyed the general implementation of React, while there is much more to learn about React, I believe that this was a good starting point to have. 

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* One of the main challenges faced was the implementation of the players compare page, the API endpoint that I had used does not list players, but does return a single player by ID. As we do not know these unique ID's it had presented a challenge of getting the desired players. I had resolved this by downloading a typeScript folder with  these players ID's and Names, converting it to a JS file and using that to get the ID and run the API call. 
* On the Team Compare page I have utilized a polar area chart, which had proven to be quite challenging at first, the problem was that I could append 2 polar area charts through props (as opposed to the single polar area that would hold both teams). This was resolved through an empty array that would hold the length of the data and then append it after an API call was run
* The desired outcome on the player timeline page was to show a single Statistic from a player over the course of 5 years. The challenge faced here was that if a year was chosen that could not increment by 5, the entire function would break, thus no data would be displayed (eg. Alex Ovechkin, Shots, 2017/2018. This would break as it can only show 4 seasons.). I had overcome this by creating a function that would return the last year that can increment by 5 if the value is not able to increment.




#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Model Viewer
* model-viewer is an easy to implement 3D modelviewer CDn, this allows for developers to insert a 3D model format into their code and for it to be displayed as a model instead of it being an image/gif. Developers are able to explore the interactiveness, such as users being able to interact with 3d models. 

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->
* in the future I would like to implement more of React's features and prebuilt items. 
* In future I would like to implement the design decisions that I have made throughout this project, making this look more user friendly and making it more interactive
* A future improvement is more use of reusable components, while this has reusable components to a certain extent, I have not taken full advantage of this. in future I will be implementing reusable components as I have an understanding of them now.
